# Multi-Material Shape Optimiztaion for Bending and Torsion of Inextensible Elastic Rods


Implementation of a multi-material shape optimization for the cross-section of an inextensible elastic rod with respect to torsional and bending rigidity.

The repo provides the **C++**â€“implementation of the numerical experiments conducted in [[1]](#1).

The development of the software in **C++** was done by **<a href = https://aam.uni-freiburg.de/mitarb/wolffvorbeck/index.html>Steve Wolff-Vorbeck<a/>** (**University of Freiburg**) on the basis of a finite element software package created by **Prof. Patrick Dondl** (**University of Freiburg**).

For more details on the usage of the code please check the **"README.txt"** file.
